      "A recent study published in the journal JAMA Network Open found that taking a one-week break from social media significantly reduced symptoms of anxiety, depression, and insomnia among young adults. The study involved 295 volunteers aged 18 to 24, who decreased their social media usage from nearly two hours to about half an hour per day. Participants reported notable improvements in mental health after the break. ([kffhealthnews.org](https://kffhealthnews.org/morning-briefing/tuesday-november-25-2025/?utm_source=openai))\n",
